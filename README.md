## Introduction
Welcome to the Wealth of Nations MySQL project. This repository showcases the analysis of the Wealth of Nations dataset using SQL.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the power of MySQL for data manipulation and analysis using real-world data.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the "Wealth of Nations" dataset, a comprehensive collection of economic and demographic data.

## Data Manipulation
The core skill applied in this project is data manipulation. We've used MySQL to perform various operations on the dataset to extract valuable insights.
